# Supplementary Material
This is a repository of supplementary material for the submitted paper "Quantifying replicability and consistency in systematic reviews"
This repository includes: 
% 1. Results of the simulations described in the paper for n=4,8,20 with both equal and unequal sample sizes
1. All simulations code
1. Data used for generating the included examples from Cochrane-library and figures. The generating code and relevant material are included in an .Rmd file. This file requires the installation of (i) the most recent version of the package `meta` by *Guido Schwarzer*
(https://github.com/guido-s/meta) and then (ii) the designated package for replicability analysis `metarep` (https://github.com/IJaljuli/metarep). For further details, see the package Vignette and README files
