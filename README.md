# Supplementary Material
This is a repository of supplementary material for the submitted paper "Quantifying replicability and consistency in systematic reviews"
<> This repository includes:
<> 1. Results of the simulations described in the paper for n=4,8,20 with both equal and unequal sample sizes

This repository includes the simulations generating codes, in the file `simulations - submitted.R`.
The data used for generating the included examples from Cochrane-library is availbe in the `metarep` package, where in the file "reproduce_paper_examples.pdf" we demonstrate the generating of these examples. The generating code and relevant material are included in "reproduce_paper_examples.Rmd". Code execution requires the installation of 
i. the most recent version of the package `meta` by *Guido Schwarzer*
(https://github.com/guido-s/meta)
i. the designated package for replicability analysis `metarep` (https://github.com/IJaljuli/metarep). For further details, see the package Vignette and README files
<> 1. Proof of Proposition 6.1
