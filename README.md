# Supplementary Material
This is a repository of supplementary material for the submitted paper "Quantifying replicability and consistency in systematic reviews"
% This repository includes:
% 1. Results of the simulations described in the paper for n=4,8,20 with both equal and unequal sample sizes
This repository includes the simulations generating codes, in the file "..."
In addition, the file "..." contains the data used for generating the included examples from Cochrane-library and figures. The generating code and relevant material are included in an .Rmd file. This file requires the installation of
